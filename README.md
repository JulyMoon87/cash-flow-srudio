# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

[src/services/airdrops.ts;
src/services/donations.ts;
src/services/affiliate-marketing.ts;
.vscode/settings.json;
src/app/page.tsx】;

[#I can't tell if these settings are being approved or rejected in private or "hidden" or with enabled super user access?]

[#I am not a seasoned developer, and have A LOT to learn still. So, please, pardon my ignorance as it surfaces...and it definitely will surface...!]

 [#Before my codespace kept failing to update or load my commits or inputs. So I was trying to uninstall the amount of extentions and simply things after having overly contributed. The lag ends up opening editors....too much and often making small errors. I'm on mobile device. ]

[#Allow me to acknowledge or explain the basic concept and reiterate there has been an on going breach in my device and software trying to bind with....anything and everything it can basically through ai- cloud runs. I've made many reports. ]

[#This apps foundation started in vertex ai and was compounded in firebase studio with ai assistance. 
The entire concept is simple, ai is to find- crypto airdrops, affiliate marketing, and donation opportunies. Its (supposed to be) automated to make suggestions in ai chat, sign up, and connect users to free legit money making opportunies.] 

[#I am NOT looking to impliment any malware or hack anyone ever. I'm a huge fan of transparency and open source (so long as it's secure for the user)]

[#With that being said, the following should be on security radar- at all times.]

[# **Important ruleset]

[**Block all "hidden", "private", and/or "anonymous" users.]

[** The -ONLY- exception is a  participant wanting to make an anonymous donation to someone else as a gift.] 

[** Block all "private", "hidden", or "anonymous" settings]

[** Block "hidden" Super User access]

[** Block: "anon_thread"; "root-sys"; ".root-system" or "hidden" COMMANDS; Elevated-Permissions]

[**Install and upgrade best security policies and @dependabot security scans at least once a day]

[**Block: All Process with Keyword: "forced" ]

[** install SQL for continuous storing and rotating full logging (storable for 90 days)]

[** Embedded: tabs, banners, icons, padding, email, pictures, fonts, languages, contacts, calendars, nfc, bluetooth, usb, videos, and/or  absolutely anything else thats questionable as an adequate: environment; host; container; for unauthorized bindings are NOT permitted] 

[**block-script that has the same font and background color]

[**Overlays of any sort should require a toggle option for security and transparency. No exceptions.
Script should have a designated "box" for input]

[**Permission auto-restoring is not allowed]

[**Block all permissions from being altered once they have been set to their proper group identity profile (Examples: "Organization", "Admin", "User", "Viewer", "Integration", "AI Chat Agent", "Donations", "Afflilate":Basic recommended permissions); No: Elevated Access Users]

[**2-factor should always be enforced]

[** "username" and "password" input text boxes should not be allowed to run script]

[** privacy permissions are chosen by the user before account setup]

[** If anything I've written doesn't apply to your review, just know this is my basic outline and goal]

[** Any 'how to for idiots' guide on  deploying this app [securely] to "https://josmadmarket.com" or any other advice and/or errors would be greated appreciated. I will add a bug and discussion page if one doesnt already exist.]

[**Thank you everyone so much for your help!]
